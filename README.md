# GraphQL-API-Test

## What is this?
I've begun contributing to some projects that use GraphQL, but I have only used REST until now. So I wanted to become more familiar with GraphQL so that I can contribute to more aspects of these projects.

This is a simple GraphQL API, and React frontend that communicates with the API. It supports basic CRUD functionality.

Most of the code comes from this tutorial video by PedroTech: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqWzCV0kU_c

## What did I learn?
Principles of GraphQL - TypeDefs, Resolvers, Schema, Queries, Mutations, Context, Fragments, Unions, how to use Apollo GraphQL Explorer to manually test an API, how to use Apollo Client to interact with an API from the front-end

## Next Steps
This project was helpful in learning the basics, but there are a few more things I want to become comfortable with before I feel confident to contribute code to a project that uses GraphQL:
* Incorporate TypeScript
* Incorporate a real Database
* Start using code generation
* Testing GraphQL
